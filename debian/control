Description: Website Blocking
 Block distracting websites and take back your productivity. NoSurfin is a 
 personal web site blocker for Linux, capable of blocking a specific URL 
 instead of limiting you to hosts only blocking. By setting the URLs to 
 block and a specific amount of time, those websites will be blocked for 
 that time period. Great for when you want to stop surfing the web and get 
 some work done!
